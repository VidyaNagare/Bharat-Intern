# Bharat-Intern
This repository contains the code for my internship portfolio project, showcasing my skills and experiences. 
The project is built using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and interactive portfolio website. 
It includes sections such as About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact, providing an overview of my background, expertise, and past work.
Feel free to explore the code and customize it for your own use!
